### Hydra Spreading Misinformation

Hydra made people think I scammed him. This is not the case, I was paid AFTER I FINISHED WORKING ON HIS SCRIPT, he told me the script was fine then sent me money via PayPal.

### Scamming ICEE

ICEE was supposed to be paid a $10 Amazon gift card to fix his ship farm. He made it faster and more efficient for him but you still took damage so he didn't pay ICEE,
Hydra also kept the code inside of his hub.

### Hydra Hub Scripts Aren't Made by Hydra

Hydra has not scripted anything in his script, especially "his Grand Piece Online".
Hydra paid a person called "Keven" 12k robux, although personally he told me 15k and ICEE 3k before, for a ship farm instead of creating his own.

### Leeching From Other Developers

Hydra leeches from other developers for his hub, a prime example of this is me.
Hydra randomly DMd me saying he wants to be friend, I awarkwardly agreed to this and then a few moments later he offered me money to unpatch scripts in his hub.
I obviously accepted this money as it was pretty much free money, who wouldn't, but that doesn't change the fact that a developer for a hub used by 300+ people
pays random developers. I was paid to unpatch the Grand Piece Online auto farm, all they did was add a sequence so firing the remote would have a different number
each time aka first fire is 1, second fire is 2, simple enough right? This was easily bypassed with a for i = 1, 5 do fireHere() end. Hydra should've been able to
write that himself but he can't. This is a prime example of how he has no lua knowledge and is just selling other people's work.

Memes of Hydra:

Hydra claiming he wrote so many features on his own (that were found in the Straw Hub source) - https://karmanhub.com/gallery/2/1614218070_Discord_OUWMRJisAn.png

### Hydra Hub Is Identical To Straw Hub

### Hydra Has No Programming Knowledge

For those of you who aren't familiar with Hydra or his hub, he can't write his own whitelist. He started off using CypherM's whitelist but after it went private,
he asked me to write him a whitelist. I refused and referred him to my friend DaDude who agreed to write him a whitelist, DaDude wrote him a whitelist and Hydra
requested that DaDude stored the username of his users in the database, this is scummy as in the event of a data breach, although it's unlikely to happen, hundreds
of accounts can get banned. Nowhere in his ToS is this mentioned, I'd get a screenshot but I'm not in the server.
